# New Year's Countdown

I wanted to keep practicing my JavaScript coding outside of the coding bootcamp so this time I decided instead of doing a tutorial that I would use what I already knew and look for a coding challenge to build from scratch. With the New Year coming up, it seemed logical to do a countdown clock. This proved to be a bit challenging, but luckily there were a lot of resources out there and after spending some time looking at how other people made similar projects I was able to build this one on my own.

...and this is what happens when the countdown is equal to Midnight, January 1st - then it will start counting down again.
